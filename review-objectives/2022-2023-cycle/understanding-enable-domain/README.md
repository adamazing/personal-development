### Why

I want to be the best asset to my team and Flick as I can be, and become more confident and proficient when answering questions about Enable's domain.

### How

  - Continue to work as an individual contributor within the Enable squad and learn organically as I work.
  - Make use of Personal Development time to:
    - intentionally and actively learn more about Enable's domain, especially within areas I'm least familiar.
    - document/depict more complex aspects of Enable's domain in a way that will benefit myself and others.
