### What

Directly aligned with Developer Competency Framework: [Leadership > Co-operation > Process thinking](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pMblIV0WGZZc8M6QzqUfnteK5qFGlCpjRUIlf0ArWb8/edit#gid=75453062&range=D74:D75)

> "As an IC within the Enable team I want to be able to identify ways to improve the way the squad works and feed those back to the team in a way that leads to positive change/growth."

### Why

Continuous improvement should be applied to ways of working but requires intention and active participation. As a member of a team I wish to become a more intentional and active participant in this process.

### How

  - Take [notes](notes.md) on perceived issues as they happen to enable and inform:
    - Engagement in squad rituals such as retrospectives and
    - Topic specific discussions about ways we can improve as a team.
