This is a place to make notes during sprints so that -- come retrospective -- I can remember what went well and what didn't go so well

## Sprint 5 - In Progress
<details open> <summary>Cheers, Jeers, and Ideas</summary>

#### Cheers - Sprint 5
  + Emma is here!
  + Always happy to come to Wellington and see everyone üôÇ
  + Really enjoying story refinement in the Payments Team tools epic/pairing with Elspeth

#### Jeers - Sprint 5
  + Yak shaving at refinement? Are we getting bogged down in too much detail.
    - Some detail is good üëç
    - Sufficient detail is ‚ú®awesome‚ú®
    - Too much detail can be a waste of time/detrimental to understanding üôÅ
  + First time doing performance reviews, trying my best and feeling it üò•

#### Ideas - Sprint 5
  + How can we as a squad best support Brother Francisco in his Personal Development/Ruby-learning Adventures
    + An application/project that gives a real vertical slice of everything from DB‚ÜîÔ∏èFE ?
    + Review Exercism solutions?
</details>


## Sprint 4
<details open> <summary>Cheers, Jeers, and Ideas</summary>

#### Cheers - Sprint 4
  + Good to have Chandan join us (Shipped first story üéâ)
  + No show-stopping cataclysmic events
  + Looking forward to having Emma join

#### Jeers - Sprint 4
  + Feeling bogged down in Invoiced.com work

#### Ideas - Sprint 4
  + Remedial refinement sessions when work "dries up" or we feel like we're just laying the track down in front of us?

</details>

## Sprint 3
<details > <summary>Cheers, Jeers, and Ideas</summary>

#### Cheers - Sprint 3
  + We -- as always -- swung into action and mobbed on a solution and found the cause of the billing slow-down, and fixed it.
  + We -- as always -- swung into action and resolved the payment run issue.
  + Enjoyed pairing with Elspeth and looking at/researching Hotwire.

#### Jeers - Sprint 3
  + 2 Production issues 1 Sprint
    + üò≠
  + We weren't as proactive as we could have been when production in general was struggling, and dead messages were building up in the invoice savings queue.
  + We failed to catch code that led to a 10x slow-down in prod. üòû

#### Ideas - Sprint 3
  + Benchmarking of code locally/in CI?
    + Won't expose the full extent of slow-down, but given a relative improvement/slow-down and an understanding of the scale at which code is called
    we can have a good idea of how it will run in prod.
  + Load-testing in UAT/Enable?
    + Consensus is that we don't have a close-enough analog for prod to do this well.
  + Identify critical code / oft-called code for specific scrutiny.

## Sprint 2
<details> <summary>Cheers, Jeers, and Ideas</summary>

#### Cheers - Sprint 2
 + Francis really smashing it
 + Hotwire/TurboFrames looks really neat

#### Jeers - Sprint 2
 + Haven't been feeling that great
