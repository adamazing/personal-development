### What

Directly aligned with Developer Competency Framework: [Delivery > Incremental Value Delivery > Work breakdown](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pMblIV0WGZZc8M6QzqUfnteK5qFGlCpjRUIlf0ArWb8/edit#gid=75453062&range=D58:D59)

> "Can split a feature or epic into stories. Works with the squad to ensure that epics and projects are appropriately broken down, prioritised, and well understood by the squad. Able to accurately predict effort per task and epic."

### Why

I want to grow my technical skills to the point where I could one day tech lead a team with confidence and proficiency.

### How

  - Continue to participate actively in squad rituals and the process of refinement and planning as part of the team.

  - Take ownership of a feature or epic and, with the assistance of the Tech Lead where appropriate, be responsible for refinement and breakdown.
    - E.g.
      - Payment arrangements
      - Direct credits (partially)
    - Next:
      - Delivery tasks and user stories for notes syncing
