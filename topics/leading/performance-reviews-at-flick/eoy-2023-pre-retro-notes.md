# Questions

## Wording

> *"Looking back over the past year"*

Period under review began 1st March and ostensibly runs until 31st December (9 months), but we're asked to write them *by* the 22nd November (more like 8.5 months).


# Feedback

***Gather early, gather often***

Some squad leads/delivery managers/colleagues are AMAZING at giving feedback with only minor encouragement/coaching/interrogation

Some are not so great
 - Scant information of any kind
 - Incredibly positive feedback and no areas for improvement


# Objectives

How do other people get the scope right? Is there a right scope?
What does good look like?

Alex had ~6 objectives, mostly just with titles and a couple of key results

Is it better to create 6 objectives, with a couple/few being easily attainable/aligned with squad work, a couple being slightly more challenging, and another couple being real stretch goals?

Does having 2-3 smaller-in-scope objectives marked as achieved trump 3 large objectives with 66-99% completion and challenging key results (some not complete)?

Key results that don't have at least some component of BAU work seem far less achievable/likely to be achieved, based on my wet-finger-in-the-wind reckons.  

I know I am in a unique position (well, actually, that's not true any more thanks to Annika ðŸ˜…) as Just(tm) a People Lead:
 - How can squad/tech leads and people leads collaborate on defining achievable goals for our people?
   - E.g. if Francis wants to build his knowledge of Stimulus/Hotwire but there is no work that will require it planned for the PayPals' coming increment...
