# How to balance individual contributor work and manager work w/ Andrew Murphy

Andrew opened with a self-deprecating tale from his early days as a tech lead of 10 (at 24yo). He made himself the "central nexus of information/support" to the point that he ended up eating his lunch with a paper hat on his head that had "Andrew is at lunch now" on it. He related that he was solving the problem of "people need more of my time than I can give" by addressing the symptom -- my lunch-time is being interrupted -- instead of the disease: having a team that was too dependent on him.

## Should I Just Split 50/50

No.

Some work is *proactive* and can be planned and organised. 
But some is *reactive* and cannot.   

Splitting depends on it being *all* proactive.

Both IC work and manager work have reactive elements.  
 i.e. P1 Incident, a report needs support urgently

## So...what can we do about it?

### Should we just split our time 50/50?

No...but yes. 😅

### Self-scheduling

#### Schedule in focussed "Leadership Time"  
 - Sneaky meetings to avoid people ignoring "focus time"-type meetings 😂  
   i.e. "TPS Report Discussion" with manager   

 **\[Adam Editorial\]**  
This seems like a smell indicating that colleagues aren't respecting boundaries/or you're operating in a low-trust environment  
**\[/Adam Editorial\]**

### Conscious decisions
Focus your "Leadership Time" on the most impactful work  
As with IC/technical work, don't focus on the out*PUT*, focus on the out*COME*
   
#### Things to do in your "Leadership Time"
  - Communication and Collaboration
  - Team Development and Mentoring
  - Vision/Strategy Alignment
  - Self scheduling
  - Self-care
  - Delegating Responsibilities
  - Continuous Learning
  - Feedback and Recognition
  - Automation and Efficiency

#### Things to consider adjusting or delegating 
  - Direct Involvement in All Technical Tasks
  - Low-Impact Meetings
  - Recruitment
  - Detailed Data Analysis
  - Minor Decision-Making
  - Repetitive Problem-solving
  - Training and Onboarding
  - Routine Reporting
  - Team Ceremony Facilitation

## Self-care

Put on your own mask first  
Taking care of yourself is not a sign of weakness or indulgence  

 - Set realistic expectations
 - Seek support
 - Focus on your physical and mental wellbeing
 - Burning yourself out helps nobody
 - Take your lunch break
 - Establish clear boundaries between work and personal life
 - Regularly reassess and adjust goals
 - Continuous learning
 - Celebrate achievements

## Breakout

Adam:
  - IC and People Lead  

Aaron:  
  - IC now but was team leader   

Bee:  
  - Team Lead roles in past but Senior Engineer now on career break  
  - "Why would you *not* want to be a manager full-time?"  

---
No "sneaky meetings" needed for we lucky few  
 - Good working relationships
 - Can sometimes require cultivation/communication  

Hard sometimes to plan/manage proactive IC meetings with people with busier schedules.


### Other groups
Delegation
  - Principles of delegation
    Confidence in delegatee's competence

Feedback loop
  - More senior you get, the longer it takes to get feedback
  - IC ---> CTO
    Bigger ships take longer to turn
