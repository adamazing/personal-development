# COACHING QUESTIONS

### To help explore the depth and width of their challenge  
1. "_What's going well and what's not feeling right about_ *____*_?_"  
1. "_What are 1 or 2 things would you change __first__ about_ *____*_?_"  
1. "_What 1 or 2 things would you keep the same?_"  
1. "_What's been the hardest part about_ *____*_?_" or
   "_What's your biggest worry about this?_"
1. "_Six months from now, how do you want to be feeling about this? What's the ideal state?_"
1. "_If you didn't have to worry about_ *____*, _what would you do?_"  
1. "_What options _haven't_ you tried yet?_" 
1. "_Let's brainstorm for a bit, what are 3+ ways you could achieve_ *____* _**and**_ *____*_?_"

### To narrow down options   
1. "_What are 1 or 2 experiments you could test first to see which is the right approach?_"  
1. "_I hear that there's X, Y, and Z all going on.  If you had to pick one of those to address first, what would it be?_"  
1. "_What's your gut feeling about these options - which would you choose on spidey sense alone?_"

### To place "guardrails" 
1. "_I am concerned about_ *____*. _On a scale of 1 to 10 (10 is really bad), how bad do you think it actually is?_"  
1. "_If you/we choose_ *____*, _what 3 things could go wrong (there's always things that can go wrong, so let's just plan for them in case we can prevent them)?_"  
1. "_I wondered if_ *____* _was what caused_ *____*, _how do you see it, is my assessment off?_"  
1. "_I worry that if we_ *____*, _then_ *____* _will happen, how can we avoid/prevent this?_"  
1. "_Knowing what we know now, what 1 or 2 things do we need to do next to prevent_ *____*_?_"  

### If the person seems upset  
1. **Make room for context**:  
"_It would help me to understand, what feels most upsetting about this?_"
1. **Clarify**:  
If they give you a vague phrase, such as "feels wrong" or "seems off-brand", encourage them with:  
"_Say more about that - what makes it feel_ *____*"
1. **Look for Bright Spots:**  
"_Ok, I hear that it really didn't work well when X, Y, Z happened. When do you feel it worked well?_"  or "_When does this not happen?_"
1. **In your shoes:**  
"_If you were me, what would you do next about this?_"
1. **Collaborate:**  
"_I would like to find a solution together on this -- but likely need your help -- what could both of our teams do to make it substantially better by Q2?_" 

### To invite them to be honest and give you/the team feedback  
1. "_What 3 goals do you think we should be prioritizing?_" [let them answer]  
"_How well do you think we're doing with each of those?_"
1. "_If you could improve this by 10%, what would you do first?_"
1. "_You're a person who has a good sense of how folks are taking this -- what do you think people would like/hate about option A vs B?_"
1. "_What do you wish you had more direction/clarification from me about?_" or  
"_What 3 things could you/we try this week to create more clarity?_"

## THE OTHER HALF OF COACHING

- Ask them if you can take notes so you don't miss anything - it shows you're not just passively listening and can help you track the conversation better.  

- Only ask a question with __*authentic*__ curiosity. People can tell when someone is not genuinely interested in their answers, 
so open questions only work if your tone and body language honestly convey that you are curious and non-judgmental about whatever their answer might be.  

- Avoid machine-gun questioning: Leave 2 seconds of silence after they're finished talking -- this gives them room to think further, and often they'll start talking again and share a deeper thought (they usually do - this is awesome) 

- Look for words, metaphors, and underlying values and passions they repeat, then confirm with them if your inference is correct:  
  
  "_It sounds like you really love_ *____*, _is that right?_"  

- Do not accidentally phrase open questions as closed questions, for example:  
  
  "_How are you feeling about this?_" is not the same as "_Are you happy with how things are going?_".  
  
  Open questions invite others to "tell their story" in their own words without leading them in a specific direction. 
  It might take a few extra minutes, but the connection they'll feel to the final solution/conclusion will pay off in the end.  

- Affirmations: Open questions require also being skilled with affirmation. These are statements and gestures that recognize their experience, and their strengths and acknowledge their values.  
  
  Affirmations make the person feel whole and seen. Examples of affirming responses:  

  &nbsp;&nbsp; _I appreciate that you are willing to talk this through_  
  &nbsp;&nbsp; _I can tell how much_ *____* _matters to you_  
  &nbsp;&nbsp; _I can tell how hard you're working on_ *____*  
  &nbsp;&nbsp; _I appreciate your ability to consider this in addition to the other priorities I know you're also managing._  

- Reflective Listening: Reflective listening is meant to close the loop in communication and ensure breakdowns don't occur, 
and can start with the basic: "_So you feel.../ It sounds like you.../ You're wondering if..._"  

- Summaries: Summarizing helps to ensure that there is clear communication and can provide a stepping stone towards change.  

  Begin with a statement indicating you are making a summary. For example:  
  - "_Let's zoom out for a second...it sounds like X, Y and Z matter most, is that right?_"; or  
  - "_Here is what I've heard - tell me if I've missed anything: *____*_"
