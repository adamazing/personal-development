## Context
Not feeling great today (tyre blew on the deviation) and listening to Rainy Day Music

## Plan

Tackle some small chunks to feel better.

Work through some more of The Rust Book and some exercises(? If time.) in support of:
 - Personal goal to learn more about Rust.
 - Possibly performance-review related goal to improve at breaking down problems.
   - Use PlantUML to diagram solution(s) if necessary.

## Notes


### General

  - Some traits can be automatically derived, e.g. Debug trait for a struct can be automatically derived if its fields already have Debug trait defined.
    ```Rust
    #[derive(Debug)]
    struct SimpleStruct {
        foo: String,
        bar: u32,
      }
    ```

### Custom Types

  - Structures
    - Three types of structures/structs:
      1. Tuple structs which are named tuples
      1. Classic C `structs`
      1. Unit structs, field-less (useful for generics)
  - Shorthand initialisation:
    - The following are equivalent if variable names match the field names:
      ```Rust
      let person = Person { name, age }
      ```
      ```Rust
      let person = Person { name: name, age: age }
      ```

### Types

 - Casting:
    - Rules follow C convention except where C has UB
    - All casts are well-defined in Rust
 - Literals:
    - Numeric literals can be annoted with a type suffix, e.g.:
      - `1u8`, `1234u32`, `3.0f32`
 - Inference:
    - The Rust compiler is really smart
      - doesn't just look at value expression during variable initialisation, it also looks at the variable's usage.
      - E.g. it can infer the type of a vector is `Vec<u8>` given it has had a u8 integer pushed to it.
  - Aliasing
    - The `type` statement can be used to create an alias to an existing type. Types must have UpperCamelCase names to avoid a warning.
      - The exception to this rule are the primitive types (e.g. usize, f32, etc.)

## Results

  -  Refreshed knowledge of structs / type aliases.
  -  Made some reasonably good notes highlighting important things encountered.
  -  Feel better.
