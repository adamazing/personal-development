# Adam's Personal Development Repo

A repository for all links/notes/docs/spikes/projects related to @adamazing's personal development, in and out of Flick.

# Introduction

This README should provide a high-ish-level plan for the next 6-12 months of personal development time, in and out of Flick.
The structure of the repository is subject to change, but should prioritise discoverability/recall of evidence of work/play in support
of my personal development goals and provide personal accountability.

# Goals / Areas Of Focus

# Strategic Objectives

## Specific Areas of Study/Development To Support Flick Performance Goals

Ideas for PD time or hackdays that aim to directly support performance goals. Where applicable, record which high-level goal is supported by the task/activity or reading/resource.

### Tasks / Activities

  * Diagram processes / current state of Enable services (Goals 1 & 2)
    * Use [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com) to diagram Payment Arrangements work
    * Use PlantUML to diagram Enable-stewarded services and their interactions, e.g. Billing/Payments

### Reading / Resources

  * Architectural Thinking
    * [Domain Driven Design](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/DomainDrivenDesign.html)
    * [Domain Driven Design Albera Tree](https://app.albera.com/u/adam935ee6/domain-driven-design/)
    * [Microservices Architecture Albera Tree](https://app.albera.com/u/adam935ee6/microservices-architecture/)
  *

## PD Time Research/Activities in support of Flick Hackdays Projects

A place to record any personal/work PD time invested in growing skills that may only be relevant in support of the most tangential work-related projects. Associate topics in this section with the relevant Trello card on the Hackdays board.

### ZSH (And Posix) Scripting

`flick_cli` has a shell-script component that launches various commands like aws, terraform, etc. but also connects to the rails console and bash console on instances of Flick services.
